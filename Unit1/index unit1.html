  <p>Known for stealing catalytic converters, Mothman has been the center of local legends for nearly 60 years. Each year, Mothman devotees from around the world gather in Point Pleasant, West Virginia to pay hommage to this benevolent cryptid. Past sightings have been interpreted as an ominous warning of disaster to come by the locals. Many tourists hope to catch a glimpse of the mysterious creature, but few are fortunate enough to bear witness.</p>

  <p>Though not as widely known outside of the Point Pleasant, West Virginia area, sightings of the Sheepsquatch date back to the mid 1990s. Initially the creature was said to run from humans, but the legend of the Sheepsquatch has become more aggressive over time. There is speculation that this wooly, white, ram horned creature hails from the TNT area which is best known for Mothman sightings.</p>
