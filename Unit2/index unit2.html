  <p>The battle for power in Westeros has been ongoing for centuries, starting when the First Men came to conquer the land. Early in the history of Westeros, it was said to be inhabited by the children of the forest and magical creatures such as giants and direwolves. The First Men battled and defeated the children of the forest, shattering Westeros into hundreds of petty kingdoms. It would take 9,000 years of war and winter to pare down those petty kingdoms into 6 primary but powerful kingdoms. Of those 6, there are 3 primary houses who compete for glory as the one true kingdom. </p>
